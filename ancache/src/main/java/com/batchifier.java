I am looking for the exact Shape and LSTM block configurations to work with StandfordQuestionAnsweringDataset.
This is my first model using DJL. I am using PyTorch as the underlying ML engine. I am trying to use the StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset for question & answering pattern. Using the DJL example, I came up with the following code:
public class LstmExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        int batchSize = 32;
        Arguments arguments = new Arguments().parseArgs(args);
        if (arguments == null) {
            return;
        }
        // Step 1: Prepare TextDataset for training and testing
        StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset trainDataset = StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset.builder()
                .setSampling(batchSize, true)
                .optUsage(Dataset.Usage.TRAIN)
                .optDataBatchifier(new SimplePaddingStackBatchifier(0))
                .optLabelBatchifier(new SimplePaddingStackBatchifier(0))
                .build();
        trainDataset.prepare(new ProgressBar());

        // Prepare StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset for testing
        StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset testDataset = StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset.builder()
                .setSampling(batchSize, true)
                .optUsage(Dataset.Usage.TEST)
                .optDataBatchifier(new SimplePaddingStackBatchifier(0))
                .optLabelBatchifier(new SimplePaddingStackBatchifier(0))
                .build();
        testDataset.prepare(new ProgressBar());

        // Step 2: Create your model
        Model model = Model.newInstance("lstm", arguments.getEngine());
        model.setBlock(getLSTMModel());

        // Step 3: Create a trainer
        DefaultTrainingConfig config = new DefaultTrainingConfig(Loss.softmaxCrossEntropyLoss())
                .addEvaluator(new Accuracy())
                .optDevices(new Device[] {Device.cpu()});

        try (Trainer trainer = model.newTrainer(config)) {

            // Step 4: Initialize trainer with proper input shape
            trainer.initialize(new Shape(?????????));

            // Step 5: Train your model
            EasyTrain.fit(trainer, 2, trainDataset, testDataset);

            // Step 6: Evaluate your model
            EasyTrain.evaluateDataset(trainer, testDataset);

        }
    }

    private static Block getLSTMModel() {
        SequentialBlock block = new SequentialBlock();
        block.addSingleton(
                input -> {
                    Shape inputShape = input.getShape();
                    long batchSize = inputShape.get(0);
                    long channel = inputShape.get(1);
                    long time = inputShape.size() / (batchSize * channel);
                    return input.reshape(new Shape(batchSize, time, channel));
                });
        block.add(
                new LSTM.Builder()
                        .setStateSize(64)
                        .setNumLayers(1)
                        .optDropRate(0)
                        .optReturnState(false)
                        .build());
        block.add(BatchNorm.builder().optEpsilon(1e-5f).optMomentum(0.9f).build());
        block.add(Blocks.batchFlattenBlock());
        block.add(Linear.builder().setUnits(10).build());
        return block;
    }
}

What should be the numbers in the shape configuration in the line trainer.initialize(new Shape(?????????));

I'd be glad to help you determine the correct shape for trainer.initialize in the provided code using DJL for a question answering model with StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset and an LSTM block.

Understanding the Shape Components:

The shape in trainer.initialize(new Shape(?????????)) specifies the expected dimensions of the input data that your model will receive during training. In this case, we need to consider the structure of the data provided by the StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset.

StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset (SQuAD) Structure:

SQuAD typically provides two main components:

Context: The passage of text from which the answer needs to be found.
Question: The query that needs to be answered based on the context.
While DJL's StanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset doesn't explicitly specify the exact format, we can infer a reasonable structure based on common practices for question answering tasks:

Batch Size (Dimension 0): This represents the number of questions and contexts processed together in a single training step. You've already set this to batchSize in your code.
Sequence Length (Dimension 1): This indicates the maximum length (number of tokens) for either the context or the question (whichever is longer). Padding will be used to ensure all sequences in the batch have the same length.
Embedding Dimension (Dimension 2): This denotes the size of the vector representation for each word in the vocabulary. This depends on the word embedding technique you'll use (e.g., pre-trained Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings).
Deriving the Shape:

Based on these assumptions, a possible shape for the input could be:

Shape(batchSize, maxSequenceLength, embeddingDimension)
Example (Assuming batchSize = 32, maxSequenceLength = 128, and embeddingDimension = 100):

Shape(32, 128, 100)
Key Points to Consider:

The actual embedding dimension depends on your chosen word embedding technique.
Adjust maxSequenceLength based on the typical length of contexts and questions in your dataset to avoid excessive padding.
If SQuAD provides separate data structures for context and question, you might need to concatenate or combine them appropriately before feeding them into the model.
Additional Tips:

Explore DJL's documentation for available data batchifiers that might handle padding and other preprocessing tasks automatically.
Consider using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for the word embedding layer, as they can often improve performance.
I hope this comprehensive explanation helps you determine the correct shape for trainer.initialize in your code!

Does my code correctly pads the dimensions? 

volume_up
The code you provided might not correctly pad the dimensions in all cases, depending on the implementation of SimplePaddingStackBatchifier. Here's a breakdown of the limitations:

SimplePaddingStackBatchifier (Potential Issues):

This batchifier likely assumes a single input tensor for both context and question.
It pads the entire tensor with a single value (specified by the paddingValue argument, which defaults to 0 in your code).
Padding Considerations for Question Answering:

In question answering tasks, you typically have separate tensors for context and question.
Padding should be applied independently to each tensor to ensure they have the same maximum length within a batch.
This is because the context and question sequences might have different lengths naturally.
Possible Improvements:

Custom Batchifier:

Create a custom batchifier that:
Takes separate context and question tensors as input.
Pads each tensor independently with the same padding value.
Combines the padded tensors into a single output tensor (if needed by your model).
Preprocessing:

If the dataset provides context and question as separate data structures, preprocess them before feeding them to the batchifier.
This preprocessing might involve:
Padding each sequence individually to the maxSequenceLength.
Concatenating the padded context and question sequences into a single tensor.
Choosing the Approach:

If DJL offers batchifiers designed specifically for question answering tasks, consider using them for automatic padding.
Otherwise, a custom batchifier or preprocessing step would be necessary for proper padding in this scenario.
By addressing these padding considerations, you can ensure that your model receives correctly padded data for training and avoid potential issues arising from mismatched sequence lengths.

Please write code for a batchifier using DJL

volume_up
Here's an example of a custom batchifier in DJL that handles separate context and question tensors with independent padding:

Java
public class QAPaddingBatchifier implements Batchifier {

    private final int paddingValue;

    public QAPaddingBatchifier(int paddingValue) {
        this.paddingValue = paddingValue;
    }

    @Override
    public NDList batchify(NDList data, Device device) throws TranslateException {
        NDList batch = new NDList();

        // Extract context and question tensors (assuming separate data structures)
        NDList contextList = data.subList(0, data.size() / 2);
        NDList questionList = data.subList(data.size() / 2, data.size());

        // Get the maximum sequence length (consider context and question separately)
        int maxContextLength = 0;
        for (NDArray context : contextList) {
            maxContextLength = Math.max(maxContextLength, context.shape().get(1));
        }
        int maxQuestionLength = 0;
        for (NDArray question : questionList) {
            maxQuestionLength = Math.max(maxQuestionLength, question.shape().get(1));
        }

        // Pad each context and question tensor independently
        NDList paddedContextList = new NDList();
        for (NDArray context : contextList) {
            paddedContextList.add(pad(context, maxContextLength, device));
        }
        NDList paddedQuestionList = new NDList();
        for (NDArray question : questionList) {
            paddedQuestionList.add(pad(question, maxQuestionLength, device));
        }

        // Combine padded context and question into a single output structure (if needed)
        // You can modify this based on your model's input requirements
        for (int i = 0; i < paddedContextList.size(); i++) {
            NDList combined = new NDList();
            combined.add(paddedContextList.get(i));
            combined.add(paddedQuestionList.get(i));
            batch.add(combined.concat(new int[]{1})); // Concatenate along sequence dimension
        }

        return batch.toDevice(device);
    }

    private NDArray pad(NDArray array, int maxLength, Device device) {
        int currentLength = array.shape().get(1);
        if (currentLength >= maxLength) {
            return array;
        }
        NDArray padding = NDArray.ones(new Shape(array.shape().get(0), maxLength - currentLength), device)
                .mul(paddingValue);
        return NDArray.concat(new NDList(array, padding), 1);
    }
}
